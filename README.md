The `HousingShow` component of this app has the most features built into it. These include:
* Show `Housing`'s details
* Show list of `Bookings`
* Show list of `Reviews` and average review score
* Render a `Google Maps` of location
* Allow logged in `User` to leave `Reviews` and `Bookings`

## Features to Come

### Better Styling  
Smooth out styling of forms, partitions, and animations to make a better looking app.  

### `Searchbar`  
Implement a working `Searchbar` within the `NavBar` to allow searching of `Housings` from anywhere in the app.  

### Dynamic `HousingsIndex`  
With the implementation of a `Searchbar`, allow for the `HousingsIndex` to dynamically show different lists of properties grouped under different cities.
